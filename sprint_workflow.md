# sprint workflow

#### sprint whip

The sprint whip is a rotation - the whip's job is to run planning, standups, plan lunch, grooming, demo/retro. **The most important part is to keep meetings focused and on track** - interrupt people to make sure this happens, and ask that tangents are taken offline.

#### sprint planning

Here's a step-by-step for running sprint planning:

1. look over retrospective from previous sprint
1. create the new sprint in JIRA
1. end the previous sprint, which will roll over unfinished work
1. re-estimate work that got rolled over
1. with the PM, establish priorities
1. canvass for PTO, ticket duty, release mgr duties, anything that affects developer bandwidth
1. keeping in mind developer bandwidth, for each priority, go to corresponding epic and add stories

#### standup

Standups happen every day
* share what you worked on yesterday, today, and call out any blockers
* if standups get too long, time 1 minute per person
* the goal of standup is to sync up on what we're working on and  trigger conversations

#### backlog grooming

* by the end, understand the scope and deliverables for each issue
* points are just relative measures of complexity
* point stories by fibonacci, nothing more than 13 points
* if something is too big, add a smaller investigation story

#### sneaky friday

We use the mid-sprint Friday as a 'lab day' - work on things that aren't in the roadmap. Eng-driven work, small features you'd like to see, anything you want. Make sure, however, that the sneak friday work doesn't bleed into the rest of the sprint - respect the contract.

#### demo/retro

* demos first
* retro on the board
* 'keep, stop, start'
