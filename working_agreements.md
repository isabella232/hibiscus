4. When pairing, explicitly request and yield the keyboard. The learner drives by default.
5. Shared understanding is a prerequisite for estimation.

7. We can't interrupt each other and we can't get a [conch shell](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies/Symbolism). It's everyone's responsibility to communicate respectfully.

8. Everyone expects you to be on time to meetings and participate in slackups before noon.
9. If possible, respond to DMs/@-mentions within an hour. Other teams should see replies to their comments in #eng-hibiscus-team within 24 hours.
