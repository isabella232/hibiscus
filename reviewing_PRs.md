# New PR Review Process
In addition to the regular PR review process, Hibiscus has recently introduced a
few new process requirements when reviewing PRs. These are:

#### Tests
* Every PR (Z1 fixes) should have a test assigned to it and can only
be merged after the test has passed. This can be either an integration test or a unit test.
The link to the assigned test should be added to the PR description.
This also applies to other teams whose PRs we are reviewing unless it is a narrow review.

#### Manual Testing
* PRs at this time should also be thoroughly manually tested, and all items
listed in this document should always be checked:

This process only works if everyone on the team both follows and enforces it.
That means PR owners should complete these steps, but PR reviewers should also
double-check these are complete before approving a PR.
