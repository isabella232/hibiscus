## Ticket Duty

Hibiscus picks a Whip for every sprint. The whip's responsibilities are as follows:

* Monitor the [Dev (Lotus)](https://support.zendesk.com/agent/filters/26843617), [Dev (Agent Experience)](https://support.zendesk.com/agent/filters/91228008), and [Dev (Editor)](https://support.zendesk.com/agent/filters/360162332234) views in Z1 for bug reports.
  * Respond to any new updates/questions on our existing Z1s queue
  * Create JIRA tasks in the bugs epic and link back to the new task in the ticket. It's important that anyone reporting a bug understands (a) whether it's valid and validly assigned to Hibiscus (b) when/if it will be fixed (c) where to watch for updates
  * Discuss newly opened bugs in standup and escalate them to Amy or Nimisha if necessary.
  * For egregious or urgent bugs we should start on a fix immediately. Post in #eng-hibiscus-p that you or someone else will be picking up the story or discuss in standup.
  * For non-emergencies, we typically estimate at the next grooming.
  * Assign any fixed/resolved tickets back to the reporting advocate with a comment.

* Also monitor #ask-hibiscus, #ticketduty, #lotus, #lotus-react, and the incoming webhook integrations for questions and bug reports.
  * Respond to non-urgent requests within 24 hours
  * Respond to urgent-requests ASAP
  * For bugs in Hibiscus-owned code reported in these channels, follow the same process defined for Z1 bugs.

* Write up & deploy at least one test spec during the sprint. Test engineer could pair with you whenever you need help, and doesn’t expect this taking more than a couple of hours each sprint.
* Periodically monitor [Support Error Budget Dashboard](https://zendesk.datadoghq.com/dashboard/zze-hp9-9ca/support-error-budget)
  * If the error budget dips below acceptable levels investigate which metrics are failing and work with the team to fix those issues.
* Pick a venue and make arrangements for team lunch during the sprint.
* Lead process meetings
* Nominate a new whip at the retrospective at the end of the sprint
* Ensure that another team member fills in for you when you're out of the office.
