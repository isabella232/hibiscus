## Internships

Positive internship experiences are the result of a lot of work, and this work begins well before the interns arrive.

### Interviewing intern candidates

Successful interns have had the following characteristics:

* An obvious passion for great UX
* A workable knowledge of JS, or enough confidence where learning a new language is not a significant barrier
* Initiative

Interviewing interns is hard, especially when they have limited experience with which to demonstrate ability. However, we should generally be holding them to the same bar as we would a FT junior hire.

#### Intern phone screens

We should use the same [phone screen](/interview_guide.md#phone-screen) as we do for FT.

#### Intern onsites

We should use the same process as the FT onsite, though we have two fewer slots.

* Talk through experience, skills
* Gauge comfort level with some programming language (JS preferred)
* Pair on some feature at Hibiscus desks

More details in the [interview guide](/interview_guide.md#onsite-wip) - look at the first three onsite panel descriptions.

### Before they arrive

* About a month before the internship begins, start collecting project ideas from the team
* About a week before, send the intern a welcome email with several of the most promising ideas
* By the time the intern arrives, we should have a clear plan for the first few weeks

### Project selection

Good projects typically have some of the following characteristics:
* A well-defined concrete end goal
* Small incremental goals along the way, each delivering some value if possible
* Some recon work already done to verify the plausibility of the project
  > An exciting idea with clear goals can quickly turn into a slog if the proper technical prep has not been done

### Keeping internships on course

* Start small - pair on something to bring interns up to speed with the product and process
* Encourage showing work, committing often
* In the beginning, check in every day (multiple times if you need) with your intern
  * Scale back attention as both people get more comfortable. It's important to set a healthy and open working relationship
* Documentation is good. Have APIs and motivations explained; it's hard to go overboard
* Exposure to how other teams work is valuable too
* Stay nimble - if a project is not working for whatever reason, it's okay to find something else to work on

### Gauging success

* Have we confirmed that we want to extend an offer to this developer?
* Can you easily picture something that this intern will work on as a fulltime developer?
* As a fulltime software engineer, your top priority is no longer learning but shipping. Will that cause problems?
* In addition to being a promising hire in general, is their skillset and experience a good fit for the team?
